## AVL Tree
## Overview

This project is an **AVL Tree Visualizer** that helps users understand how AVL trees work by providing interactive visualizations of insertions, deletions, and rotations. AVL trees are self-balancing binary search trees, ensuring O(log n) time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations.

## Features

- Visualize AVL tree structure in real-time
- Step-by-step animations for insert and delete operations
- Highlights tree rotations (LL, RR, LR, RL)
- Displays node heights and balance factors
- User-friendly interface for adding and removing nodes


## Usage

- Enter values to insert or delete nodes.
- Watch the AVL tree update and rebalance automatically.
- Hover over nodes to see their height and balance factor.
